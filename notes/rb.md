# Rainbow 100A/100B/100+/190 Notes

This document represents my notes, slightly organized, on what I've
learned about the DEC Ranibow. They pull in bits and pieces of
documentation, and have observations from reading through the
schematics, available sources, etc.

## Notes on Reading Schematics

"SHx SIGNAL [LH]" is the convention. SHx tells you that it's generated
on sheet X. L or H says it's active Low or Active High.

## Interrupts

The Rainbow has 8 interrupts that it can generate. These are
hard-wired on the motherboard from different sources. Unlike the
IBM-PC, there's no PIC chip. The Rainbow selects whatever line is
asserted based on priority.

| Interrupt | Source | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 27H | SH8 IN 88 L | Interrupt from the Z80 |
| 26H | SH6 KBD INT L | Keyboard interrupt from 8251A |
| 25H | SH10 BDL INTR L | Interrupt from expansion card (pin 23 J4) |
| 24H | SH9 COMM/PRT INTR L | Interrupt from the uPD7201 for shared comminucations and printer port |
| 23H | SH10 DMAC INTR L | Another interrupt from expansion card, used by advanced communications card to signal DMA complete (pin 5 J4) |
| 22H | SH10 GRF INTR L | Graphics card interrupt (pin 38 J7) |
| 21H | SH10 BDL INTR 1 L | Third interrupt from expansion card (pin 21 J4) |
| 20H | SH3 VERT INTR L | Vertical Blanking Interrupt (this is your timer) generated by DC12 |

Makes for a lovely machine to port DOS to given its use of INT 21H
for its system calls.... But I digress... or do I?

![Rainbow Interrupt Selection](rb-intr-select.png)

![Rainbow Interrupts](rb-8088-intr.png)

Has the circuit that puts the interrupt number on the bus during. We
feed all the interrupts into the 74LS373 (E80) Quad Latch. This is
latched when `SH1 INTA L` is asserted. The i8088 asserts this at the
right phase of the interrupt cycle so devices can put their data on
the bus. The 74LS148 (E79) 8-line to 3-line priority encoder picks the
D line with the highest number and outputs it on A0-A2 (inverted, so
D7 is output as 0, D6 as 1, and D0 as 7). This is how priority in
interrupts are selected... So those are fed into the 74LS244 (E74)
Octal Line buffer / driver with D5 wired high and D7 controlled by
`SH6 VECTOR SELECT L`. D5 is where the '2x' in all the above signals
comes from. But what the heck is this vector select thing. It's
generated here:

![Rainbow Keyboard UART](rb-kbd-uart.png)

So the keyboard's DTR signal? What's up with that? Well, turns out
that the LK201 keyboard on the Rainbow is 4 wires: +12V, GND, RxD and
TxD so this is unused. The original Rainbow 100A lacked this circuit,
so DOS had to do what's best described as 'unnatural' things to
disambiguate between hardware and software interrupts, so DEC rixed
that with the 100B. There's now a ROM BIOS call to move the vectors.
All it does is set the register in the 8251A that controls DTR and
bam! The interrupts are moved starting with the next interrupt. DOS
really needs this, but CP/M and unix don't care. INTFIX.ASM from
the different copies of the MS-DOS BIOS has all the details on
what's needed to work around this...

### Unknonws

DOS has a CLKISR at INT 2C. Question: does the ROM call this? Check
the ROM BIOS docs / disassembly.  Normally, the ROM BIOS is at
interrupt 0x28 (40 decimal), but DOS moves it to 0x18. It also sets up
a FASTCON software interrupt at 0x29 that's little more than an thin
wrapper around `INT ROM`.

## Video

### Output

The Rainbow Docs talk about a RS-170-like signal. They talk about the
need to run it through a .1uF capasitor to turn it from AC coupled to
DC coupled. But that's it. Turns out that this signal is 'old school'
15kHz composite NTSC video. You can display it with any composite
monochrome monitor (like the ones for an apple 2c).

However, it isn't quite NTSC, since it's overscanned a bit. So many of
the modern NTSC to VGA/HDMI/LCD adapters won't dispaly the whole image.

### Monochrome Video Chips

The two video chips for the monochrome output are the DC11 and
DC12. These are the two chips used in the VT100 family of
terminals. You can find out about these chips with the VT100 Series
Video Terminal Technical Manual (order number EK-VT100-TM-003) now
available at bitkeepers:
http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/terminal/vt100/EK-VT100-TM-003_VT100_Technical_Manual_Jul82.pdf
section 4.6 "Video Processor" starting on pgae 4-48. the Timing Chip
is the DC11 and the Control Chip is the DC12.

It also documents the rather odd video display lists of characters as well.

## Communications / Printer

The Rainbow has a lot of weird shit in this area.

It uses the uPD7201, which is this rather obscure part with a data
sheet that's super terse. Why on earth would they use it? Turns out,
this part is a clone of the Z80-SIO chip, which was quite common in
Z80 designs and is much better documented when you look for it under
that name.

You'll also see '8274' which is the Intel part number.

DOS sees bit 8 set and infers the presence of the hard disk controller by doing inb(0x68) & 0xe0 == 0xa0

It uses INT ROM DI==0xe to get clock rate

It also uses function 0xc to reset vectors for 02 (NMI for bad RAM)
20, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 2C which puts the graphics card and extended
option card into reset.
